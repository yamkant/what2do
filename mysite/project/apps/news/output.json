      "House prices may be headed lower, dealing a blow to sellers but providing relief to buyers, two experts say.",
      "\"The only way out of the box, the only way to get sales back up is mortgage rates have to come down, incomes have to continue to improve, we have to avoid a recession, and I suspect we'll have to see some house price declines at some point here,\" Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandi, told Yahoo Finance this week.",
      "Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman made a similar call in a Fox News interview this week. Asked about Morgan Stanley's latest forecast of a 3% drop in home prices next year, he replied that a decline \"seems not just possible, but likely.\"",
      "The housing market ground to a halt this year, as the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting hikes to interest rates have boosted mortgage rates to two-decade highs.",
      "Homeowners who locked in much cheaper rates have balked at selling up and paying heftier monthly payments for their next place. Meanwhile, prospective buyers have been priced out, and many are waiting for rates to fall instead of settling for a worse home than they wanted.",
      "\"Housing's taken it on the chin, particularly demand,\" Zandi said. He pointed to new data showing annualized sales of previously owned homes fell below 3.8 million units in October, the lowest figure in 13 years. \"You have to go back to the teeth of the financial crisis to find sales that low,\" he said.",
      "The pandemic-fueled surge in house prices, coupled with much steeper mortgage rates, have fueled an affordability crisis that has caused transaction volumes to tumble — and Zandi warned there's no immediate relief on the horizon.",
      "\"I don't expect the housing market to come roaring back here, certainly not in 2024,\" he said. \"Probably won't be until 2025, 2026 before we see sales levels that are more consistent with what we've enjoyed historically.\"",
      "Redfin's Kelman struck a more optimistic tone, suggesting the housing space is already heating up.",
      "\"There has been a change in the market, a disturbance in the force,\" he said, highlighting that the amount of housing inventory has started to increase.",
      "The real estate brokerage chief explained that more people are listing homes, and many owners who failed to sell their homes this summer are relisting them at lower prices.",
      "\"The market has just been frozen because buyers and sellers can't agree on a price,\" Kelman said. \"For the first time, there's a break in the logjam where we might see a real drop in prices, and that is going to spur sales.\"",

    "authors": "Patrick Gillespie, Kevin Simauchi and Giovanna Bellotti Azevedo",
    "body": [
      "(Bloomberg) -- In the blink of an eye, Argentine President-elect Javier Milei pivoted away from advisers advocating for his most dramatic campaign promises, choosing Wall Street veterans closer to former leader Mauricio Macri.",
      "Most Read from Bloomberg",
      "Milei’s boldest campaign proposals — dollarization and closing the central bank — appear at least on hold for now amid a staffing shake up. Milei distanced himself from his dollarization guru, Emilio Ocampo, and on Friday another hawkish adviser from early in the campaign, Carlos Rodriguez, announced on X he was departing. Milei had repeatedly said he’d name Ocampo to lead Argentina’s central bank, though he reiterated Friday that closing the institution was “non-negotiable.”",
      "In their place, Milei’s economic team is being led by Luis Caputo and Demian Reidel, two former Wall Street veterans who held key posts during Macri’s presidency from 2015 to 2019.",
      "Local media also reported Milei would appoint his former rival during the election, Patricia Bullrich, as security minister, a post she held in Macri’s government too.",
      "Argentina’s dollar bonds extended their rally Friday on signs of Milei’s more moderate stance. Securities due 2030, some of the most liquid, jumped more than two cents, pacing gains in emerging markets. Notes have jumped across the curve since Monday, with bonds maturing in 2046 up more than five cents, the best week since July 2022 — though the debt still trades at distressed levels, with bonds exchanging hands between 30 and 37 cents on the dollar.",
      "The rally was not restrained to sovereign debt. The country’s benchmark stock index, the Merval, rose 42%, the biggest weekly gain since 1991. The Global X MSCI Argentina ETF, meanwhile, jumped 16% in the same period to a record.",
      "As Milei gets closer to Macri’s team, it’s a sign that while the president-elect “will bring change, it might not be as radical a change as espoused during his campaign,” said Jeff Grills, the head of emerging markets debt at Aegon Asset Management in Chicago.",
      "“It’s also a holiday-shortened week, so any buying will exacerbate moves a bit as there isn’t much flow to offset the demand for Argentina being seen today,” Grills added.",
      "While markets welcomed Milei’s election and concerns about a surge in withdrawals amid his pledge to dollarize the economy failed to materialize, banks are fleeing to one-day notes in order to guarantee liquidity.",
      "Lenders rolled over only 10% of the 1.8 trillion pesos of so-called Leliq notes offered by the central bank at auction Thursday, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. That’s down from 40% in the Tuesday sale, which was already a sharp pullback from before the vote.",
      "The concern is if banks continue to flee the so-called Leliqs, which have 28-day maturities and are used by the central bank to absorb pesos, it could unleash more pesos into the economy, adding pressure on the parallel exchange rate and boosting inflation that’s already at 143% a year.",
      "No Jump to the Void",
      "Speculation of Caputo joining Milei’s government as economic chief demonstrates Macri’s support, “filling most of the blanks and significantly reducing the feeling of jump to the void,” according to Javier Casabal, a fixed income strategist at Adcap securities.",
      "To be sure, the president-elect still has to officially confirm who will be the key members of his economic team. Caputo, a former finance chief under Macri, appears among the most likely candidates to take over as economy minister after the transition, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News on Thursday. Caputo met with bank executives in Buenos Aires Friday to discuss Milei’s economic plans.",
      "Reidel, in the meantime, is being mentioned as candidate to lead Argentina’s central bank instead of Ocampo, local press reported. Milei said during the campaign that Ocampo, who’s an expert on dollarization, would be his central bank chief with the task of shutting down the institution.",
      "Milei also softened his stance on China and Brazil after threatening to cut diplomatic ties on the campaign trail. He even thanked Xi Jinping for a congratulatory letter, invited Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to his inauguration and took a call from Pope Francis, who he’d lambasted in the past. Even though Milei called the Chinese government “an assassin,” his foreign policy adviser, Diana Mondino, said the media over-blew the comments.",
      "From economics to foreign policy, the new tone shows Milei’s pragmatic approach to governing a fragmented congress where he’ll need the business-friendly opposition party to get any reforms done.",

      "The housing market isn't coming out of its deep freeze anytime soon, even if the US economy manages to steer away from a recession in the next year, according to Fannie Mae economists.",
      "The government-sponsored mortgage giant highlighted the stagnant US housing market, with existing home sales down 18.9% year per-year in June, according to Fannie Mae's estimate. Mortgage applications, similarly, have fallen to a 28-year-low.",
      "That slowdown has largely been spurred by high mortgage rates, which have pushed buyers and sellers out of the market. That's likely to continue no matter what happens to the US economy over the next 12 months, the firm said in a note on Wednesday.",
      "\"With an ongoing tight supply of existing homes for sale and the recent rise in 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate to around 7%, we expect home sales in 2023 to remain near the lowest annual level since 2009,\" Fannie Mae economists said. \"Regardless of whether a soft landing is achieved over the coming year, we expect existing home sales to stay subdued and within a tight range.\"",
      "That's because the US avoiding a recession means real interest rates in the economy will likely stay elevated, which will influence mortgage rates to stay high as well. Higher rates have weighed heavily on the housing market over the past year, as they slam buyers with a high cost of borrowing and discourage sellers from listing their properties for sale, many of which were financed at ultra-low rates years ago.",
      "In the event the US does fall into a recession, interest rates will likely dial back \"somewhat,\" the firm estimated, which could cause mortgage rates to ease slightly, but the housing market would still likely be affected by a weakening labor market and an ongoing crunch in credit conditions, in addition to dampened consumer confidence.",
      "\"We therefore do not anticipate a meaningful recovery in existing home sales over our forecast horizon under any of the more likely scenarios,\" Fannie Mae said.",
      "Despite growing optimism for a soft-landing in the US, it predicted the economy would finally slip into a downturn in 2024, with real GDP falling 0.2% year-over-year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Experts say housing conditions are unlikely to improve until mortgage rates dial back to the 5% range. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage, meanwhile, rose to 7.48% in the last week, according to Mortgage News Daily, touching a 23-year-high.",

The move risks driving up volatility in the market, adding to challenges for investors seeking steady returns after the surprise crackdown on selling of borrowed shares.",

      "(Bloomberg) -- When a team of Israeli technocrats that calls itself the “government’s CFO” scans the battlefield with the war against Hamas almost seven weeks in, it sees an accounting ledger with billions of debits stacking up.",
      "Most Read from Bloomberg",
      "Their job is to find the money to help pay for it all.",
      "As Israel’s military pushed deeper into Gaza with the goal of uprooting Hamas following its Oct. 7 attack, the Finance Ministry’s accountant general department was fine-tuning forecasts and updating the government’s running tab in real time by logging the costs of every missile interceptor, every flight and every day of deployment by reservists.",
      "Those expenses are quickly adding up, even as a hostage deal now holds out the prospect of a four-day pause in the deadly conflict.",
      "The war, which the Finance Ministry estimates is costing the economy around $270 million every day, will come with a fiscal price tag estimated at 180 billion shekels ($48 billion) in 2023-2024, according to Leader Capital Markets, a financial advisory powerhouse in Israel.",
      "Israel will likely be on the hook for two-thirds of the total costs, Leader said, with the US paying for the rest.",
      "Israel’s fiscal math means the government will largely have to borrow its way through what’s already its worst armed conflict in half a century. And the man in charge of managing Israel’s $300 billion debt stock is mindful of the risks.",
      "“We are moving forward with a base case scenario that references several months of combat and have worked in additional buffers,” Yali Rothenberg, the Finance Ministry’s accountant general, said in an interview. “We are well capable of financing the State of Israel even in more extreme scenarios than the current fighting.”",
      "Israel’s War Effort Is Giving Its Economy a Covid-Like Shock",
      "The fiscal shock is cascading through an economy that had to shift to a war footing in a matter of days. That came after Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the US and EU, blindsided Israel and prompted retaliatory strikes followed by a ground offensive into Gaza.",
      "Although the government has issued international debt in yen, euros and dollars through private placements via Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., it’s counting on the domestic market to absorb the bulk of its financing needs. The Finance Ministry has already sold 18.7 billion shekels of local bonds since Oct. 7, compared with a monthly average of just over 5 billion shekels through September.",
      "Demand for its securities has stayed resilient enough to reach over six times the amount on offer at some recent auctions. Moody’s Investors Service estimates the government’s gross borrowing needs at around 10% of economic output this year, up from 5.7% in 2022.",
      "Domestic interest rates have risen less in Israel than in many developed economies, making it relatively cheap for the government to borrow at home. The yield on the nation’s 10-year shekel bond has inched up since the conflict began but closed on Wednesday at 4.2% — lower than that of US Treasuries of similar maturity.",
      "Thanks in part to unprecedented interventions by the central bank, the Israeli currency has completely recouped its losses after the war began and is now trading near the strongest against the dollar since August.",
      "“If we look at the situation pre-war, the shekel was relatively weak and local capital markets were underperforming,” Rothenberg said. “Perhaps right now there is an interesting investment point in the Israeli economy.”",
      "As the conflict forced the government to open the fiscal taps, it ran up a budget deficit in October that was more than seven times bigger than a year earlier, with the gap now at 2.6% of gross domestic product. Rothenberg said it’s reasonable to expect a cumulative budget shortfall of about 9% over the next two years.",
      "What Bloomberg Economics Says...",
      "“The financial costs are unlikely to be prohibitive for Israel. The country has $191 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, enough to fund the war for about two years. It could receive further assistance from the US. And it’s borrowing from financial markets to fill the gap. What’s going to end the war isn’t economics, but domestic or international pressure as well as developments on the battlefield.”",
      "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has put forward an amended budget for the remainder of 2023 with a spending increase of 35 billion shekels that will be largely financed by debt. Israel will also have to make up for an estimated 15 billion shekels of lost revenues in 2023 and then next year re-stock a government tax-compensation fund that was emptied of 18 billion shekels to pay for expenses after the war broke out.",
      "Bond issuance at home accounts for over 80% of the total and officials don’t expect the ratio to change much, shielding Israel from volatile foreign investment flows.",
      "Riskier Proposition",
      "Israel faces a less welcoming market abroad. The cost to insure Israel’s sovereign bonds against a default has roughly doubled since the war began.",
      "For the accountant general department, the unease has meant that it’s stepping up its outreach to rating agencies as well as foreign and local market makers by providing up-to-date data and explaining developments as they unfold. It’s also trying to facilitate inflows into the high-tech industry by speaking to potential investors and companies seeking capital.",
      "“We are a country at war, but we have always had a very significant rebound after military operations and wars,” Rothenberg said.",
      "Apart from relying on domestic debt since Oct. 7, the government also used a US-registered entity that’s separate but affiliated with the Finance Ministry. It sold a monthly record of more than $1 billion of bonds bought by Israel’s supporters across the world.",
      "The country’s additionally borrowed abroad through privately negotiated deals, avoiding the scrutiny of public markets and raising a total of $5.4 billion since the war began.",
      "Israel’s recent international bond placements were to large institutional investors “who really believe in Israel even in a state of war,” Rothenberg said. “This is a strong message they are sending.”",
      "War Risks",
      "The sudden strain on Israel’s finances has put the government in the spotlight of the three biggest rating companies, all of which lowered the outlook to negative in the weeks after the war began. But Israel has so far avoided what would be its first-ever downgrade.",
      "War Budget Leaves Netanyahu Caught Between Markets and Politics",
      "In Rothenberg’s view, the decision might come down to Israel’s ability to hold back the budget deficit enough to support a medium-term decrease in the ratio of debt to GDP — which is set to grow higher than its current level of about 60%.",
      "While much of the focus is on debt, a fraught budget debate is unfolding in Israel over the fate of discretionary spending earmarked to the five parties comprising Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.",
      "The reluctance to scrap or divert the funding has drawn controversy and, in the eyes of critics, threatens to undermine the government’s credibility.",
      "Rothenberg said the special allotments should be “on the table” as Israel drafts a new economic plan for next year. “Priorities need to change as the world changed on Oct. 7,” he said.",

      "Dollarization critics have warned that a sudden currency switch could trigger a recession, citing a shortage of dollar reserves at Argentina's central bank. But Mobius said that there's plenty of dollars Argentines hold offshore.",
      "Meanwhile, the country's consumers have already adopted the US tender for many domestic transactions, from paying wages to securing Airbnb rentals.",
      "Mobius also warned that the current condition of Argentina's economy has made investing there difficult.",
      "\"We had to buy companies on the basis of their book value rather than anything else,\" he told Bloomberg TV \"But at the end of the day, it's been a very dangerous place to be with the currency the way it is and with inflation in that situation.\"",

    "title": "9 market themes to discuss around the Thanksgiving table",
    "time": "Thu, November 23, 2023 at 7:26 AM GMT+9",
    "authors": "Brad Smith",
    "body": [
      "There's plenty in markets to talk about while passing the potatoes on Thanksgiving.",
      "Inflation, work, artificial intelligence, labor strikes, and even Taylor Swift may be fodder for Turkey Day table talk.",
      "To help guide your discussions, here's what top executives, strategists, and experts have told Yahoo Finance about the biggest topics in markets right now:",
      "Consumers may notice that their Thanksgiving feast costs less than it did last year, when the price of the holiday meal hit a record high, according to the American Farm Bureau.",
      "\"As far as the consumer right now, certainly inflation is top of mind,\" Butterball CEO Jay Jandrain told Yahoo Finance. \"The great news really is ... prices are down this year, which is good to see [and] helps the consumer out.\"",
      "As of October, overall inflation has moderated, rising 3.2% over last year as the inflation-busting Federal Reserve maintains its long-run inflation target of 2%.",
      "Prices aren’t necessarily falling across the board yet, but pockets of deflation have emerged month over month and year over year.",
      "\"I think the most important observation we've made is that the worst of the inflationary environment is behind us,\" Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said during the company's third quarter earnings call, adding: \"Some prices are settling at levels higher than 2022. Others are settling lower.\"",
      "Those hitting the road this Thanksgiving may also witness a multiyear low in the national average gas price at $3.25 per gallon, according to GasBuddy forecasts.",
      "\"Looking at the nominal price today compared to where we were prior to the pandemic, while gas prices back then were about $2.80 a gallon or so … adjusted for inflation, the price today is not too far off the mark from 2018 and 2019,\" GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan said, later adding: \"65,000 stations [are] now below the $3 a gallon mark. In fact, [there are] now 13 states where average prices have also slipped below that $3 mark.\"",
      "AAA noted that sales at the pump are a leading economic indicator and anticipates that the Thanksgiving holiday will produce the third-highest travel volume on record.",
      "\"Gasoline was more expensive last year, but we’re buying less now,\" AAA Northeast senior manager Robert Sinclair told Yahoo Finance Live. \"I think that’s a strong indicator of what’s happening with personal finance and being able to deal with it.\"",
      "The OPEC+ meeting that was delayed until Nov. 30 is expected to influence gas price dynamics. The group of major oil producers led by Saudi Arabia may hint at whether it will implement additional supply cuts next year as non-OPEC countries ramp up production.",
      "ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, has dominated the generative AI discussion this year — even more so after the surprise ousting and then return of its CEO, Sam Altman.",
      "The attention thrust toward the AI startup — with implications for investors — has cast a spotlight on another household name: Microsoft (MSFT).",
      "Earlier this year, the megacap tech company announced a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, with plans to accelerate its artificial intelligence capabilities and yield a new leg of growth.",
      "Artificial intelligence has been embedded within technology for decades, but its offspring — generative AI — is expected to fuel the next industrial revolution. The benefits of AI touted by technology executives include hyper-charged productivity, accelerated intelligence, and fattened margins.",
      "\"I think it is worth remembering that AI is not a particularly new technology,\" AOL co-founder and Revolution CEO Steve Case told Yahoo Finance in late October. \"What's new is it's become much more popularized. ChatGPT, in particular, had an overnight success — almost a Netscape moment that we saw with the internet, where the internet was bubbling and selling things accelerated.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell admitted that the Fed underestimated the balance sheet strength of small businesses and households.",
      "And the central bank isn't the only one noticing stronger-than-expected consumer resilience.",
      "\"Everyone's been talking about how bad the economy is or is about to be, but when we look at the fundamentals, we're actually really constructive looking ahead,\" Drew Pettit, Citi's director of US equity strategy, told Yahoo Finance Live. \"So it's almost the boy who cried wolf here when it comes to recession.\"",
      "However, the reality is that the economy is bifurcated, and many low-income households have been feeling recession-like pressure while higher-income households have fared better.",
      "\"They don’t have excess savings anymore,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said to Yahoo Finance about lower-income consumers. \"The middle class is getting close to zero — no excess savings — but they still have jobs, and wages are going up. And then obviously wealthy people still have excess and stuff like that.\"",
      "With shelter costs remaining the largest contributor to overall inflation, the housing market continues to weigh on overall sentiment about the economy.",
      "US existing home sales fell to 3.79 million in October, a level unseen since 2010. As for new homes, things have started looking up for builders, such as Toll Brothers (TOL), which have been identifying markets where demand is rebounding.",
      "Read more: Mortgage rates at 20-year high: Is 2023 a good time to buy a house?",
      "\"While builder sentiment was down again in November, recent macroeconomic data point to improving conditions for home construction in the coming months,\" National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) chief economist Robert Dietz said in a November statement on builder sentiment.",
      "\"Given the lack of existing home inventory, somewhat lower mortgage rates will price-in housing demand and likely set the stage for improved builder views of market conditions in December,\" Dietz added.",
      "However, a demand resurgence strong enough to boost home sales and offset mortgage rates well over 7% likely depends on tens of millions of millennials entering their prime homebuying years combined with builders continuing to reduce home prices.",
      "\"It's going to be more of a slow trickle of people deciding that, 'You know, I can't wait any longer, and I want to move,'\" Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather told Yahoo Finance Live. \"But a strong economy does mean that more people are moving for job opportunities. They feel more confident. They feel like even though rates are high, they can make it work for their budget.\"",
      "According to data from Goldman Sachs, the Magnificent Seven — a group of megacap tech stocks composed of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) — represents 29% of the S&P 500's market cap. That's the largest percentage of S&P 500 market cap for a cohort of this size, ever.",
      "Goldman still bullishly forecasts an 11% compound annual growth on these names from 2023 to 2025. And it isn't alone in its assessment; a top global strategist at BlackRock believes \"there’s more to go\" for these names.",
      "\"We are currently overweight this theme, and the Magnificent Seven is a big part of that,\" BlackRock global chief investment strategist Wei Li told Yahoo Finance Live.",
      "\"Earnings are coming through for these companies,\" Li continued. \"If you look ahead to 2024 US equity earnings expectations, tech is driving 50% and more of those high-single-digit earnings growth expectations. It shows that expectations are high, but they are meeting that high bar.\"",
      "Labor negotiations throughout 2023 have threatened deep economic risks if left unresolved.",
      "Among the wide-ranging actions were an averted UPS strike, a historic Kaiser Permanente healthcare workers strike, a 148-day screenwriters strike, a 118-day actors strike, and the longest auto workers strike in 25 years.",
      "Year to date, 736,000 people in the aforementioned strikes have demanded from business executives better compensation, working conditions, healthcare coverage, and protections from replacement by artificial intelligence.",
      "But while strikes make headlines, the overall labor market that the Fed monitors has remained stable.",
      "\"This is a very solid American economic expansion featuring historic rates of employment and a very low unemployment rate,\" RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas told Yahoo Finance following the October jobs report. \"Look, average hourly earnings, they're easing. ... Take a look at the three-month run rate on that, you're going to get a much more friendly economic and financial outlook, so I don't see here much not to like.\"",
      "Even the largest retail companies and power merchandisers pulled their promotional levers early to boost sales.",
      "\"So much of our business is dependent upon the holiday shopping period,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Finance. \"The fourth quarter in general is about 20% larger for us, and ... Black Friday really is no longer a day — it's more of a concept. We at Walmart started our events on Nov. 8 with deals for our customers.\"",

      "The critical holiday shopping season comes as retailers grapple with the return of student loan payments, seen as a bogeyman for consumer spending.",
      "\"Overall, consumers are still spending, but pressures like higher interest rates, the resumption of student loan repayments, increased credit card debt, and reduced savings rates have left them with less discretionary income, forcing them to make trade-offs in their family budgets,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said on the company’s third quarter earnings call.",
      "Air travel is back, with TSA passenger throughput on pace to surpass 2019 levels, a pre-pandemic measuring stick for the steel bird operators.",
      "The airline industry has welcomed all forms of travel, whether it be for corporate events and vacations or for the record-setting Taylor Swift and Beyoncé concerts that have powered the experience economy in 2023.",
      "\"The big revenge travel, I would say, is behind us,\" Delta CEO Ed Bastian told Yahoo Finance in November. \"As you're looking at pricing, as you're looking at trends, we're coming off a peak last year, where people just needed to go. They didn't care what they paid or where they went, they just needed to get out.\"",
