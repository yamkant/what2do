    "body": "(Bloomberg) — Stocks in Asia were mixed Tuesday after Wall Street struggled in the wake of a rally that put the S&P 500 near “overbought” levels. Treasuries held their gains.Most Read from BloombergJapan equities declined at the open on speculation of profit taking, strengthening the yen. Meanwhile, MSCI’s Asia Pacific Index - a gauge for benchmarks in the region - gained in early trading, erasing Monday’s losses. Futures for Hong Kong pointed to a weaker open and contracts for US stocks were little changed.“As both Japanese and U.S. equities are at high levels driven by the bond rally, profit-taking selling is likely to occur,” said Ryuta Otsuka, a strategist at Toyo Securities. However, “hopes for an end to deflation and improvement in corporate capital efficiency continue to provide a strong outlook for Japanese equities.”Treasuries extended a rally that began Monday, sending the yield on the two-year note, which is sensitive to Fed’s rate path, down by more than three basis points to 4.85%. The benchmark 10-year yields steadied after dropping eight basis points to around 4.4%. Australia and New Zealand bonds tracked the rally in Asian hours.The world’s biggest bond market has clawed its way back after spending chunks of 2023 underwater — heading toward its best month since March. The Bloomberg US Treasury Index recently shifted to a positive return for the year as signs of slowing inflation and measured jobs growth unleashed a rally that sent yields tumbling from their highest in more than a decade.Swaps data shows investors are pricing in around 95 basis points of rate cuts from the January meeting into the end of next year.In Asia, there are signs China’s economic recovery remains fragile, with profits at industrial companies rising at a much slower pace than a month earlier as deflationary pressures persisted. The fallout from a criminal probe into shadow banking giant Zhongzhi Enterprise Group Co. continues, with one lawyer estimating investor losses could reach $56 billion.“The market appears to have embraced the idea that slowing economic data will hasten the arrival of market-friendly rate cuts, even though the Fed has continued to telegraph otherwise,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “This week will provide plenty of opportunities for traders to decide whether that cooling trend is intact.”Government debt sales in the US on Monday were met with mixed reaction, with a $55 billion auction of five-year bonds seeing strong demand while a $54 billion sale of two-year notes was soft.The dollar fell for a fourth day as it weakened against all of its major peers, with the yen leading the gains.Traders will be closely watching another batch of economic data this week, including the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation. US sales of new houses fell in October after a downward revision to the prior month as decades-high mortgage rates weighed on demand. The Fed Bank of Dallas manufacturing index for November came in softer than expected.Too PlacidBets that US policymakers are done with the rate-hiking cycle have fueled a rally in the S&P 500 this month, sinking short-term volatility expectations. While some used the opportunity to buy protection on the cheap, it’s been far from ubiquitous — and calls saying the market environment is getting too placid are on the rise.“The technical backdrop in the stock market right now is critically important,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “This does not mean that we’re about to see an important top in the stock market. It could just mean that we’ll see a mild pullback or even a ‘sideways’ correction at some point in the next week or two to work off this overbought condition.”More than 60% of respondents in the latest MLIV Pulse survey expect stocks to provide better returns than bonds over the next month. That’s the highest level of excitement about equities that the survey registered since the question about the two assets was first asked in August 2022.Wall Street forecasters have turned more optimistic about the outlook for next year as investor sentiment improves and expectations of a recession are dialed back.In earnings, Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. will underscore how businesses are prioritizing cybersecurity after recent high-profile corporate hacks, while Salesforce Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. are expected to post slower sales growth when they report this week, as overall corporate expenditure tightens.Elsewhere, gold steadied near the highest level since May, supported by a slump in Treasury yields and bets that the Fed will start cutting interest rates. Oil edged higher after a string of losses as the market weighed the possibility of deeper output cuts from OPEC+ against signs supply is running ahead of demand.Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.—With assistance from Winnie Hsu and Toshiro Hasegawa.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Investor confidence is finally returning to emerging markets as equities and bonds rally this month, luring fresh capital into exchange-traded funds that revolve around the asset class.Most Read from BloombergNet deposits into US-listed ETFs that invest across developing economies — as well as those that target specific countries — totaled $766.1 million in the week ended Nov. 24, building on gains of $1.57 billion in the previous week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That’s helped inflows into emerging-market ETFs top $10 billion so far this year. Across Wall Street, analysts have been boosting wagers that the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its monetary-tightening cycle, paving the way for more gains ahead for risky assets.“EM today is perhaps a beneficiary of a more optimistic global recovery narrative that plays into needing more commodities and securing resources,” according to Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA.While MSCI Inc.’s key gauge of developing stocks edged lower on Monday, the index has rallied for four successive weeks in November. Sovereign bond yields have shed 84 basis points on average since late October, while 19 of 23 emerging-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg are set for monthly advances.Sentiment has been improving for emerging-market stocks after a roller-coaster year sent them to a record low against US peers. As bets for a dovish Fed in 2024 builds, analysts have upgraded earnings estimates for companies in the MSCI gauge for eight successive weeks, the longest run since February 2022. That’s sent emerging-market stocks to a valuation discount of 39% versus their US peers, approaching the widest level in a year.The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF capped seven successive weeks of net deposits, drawing a total $2.1 billion. That, combined with the equity gains, has boosted the fund’s assets by almost 50% in this period.Read more: Pitfalls Lie in Wait for Emerging Markets After Bumper MonthAn ETF tracking Argentina’s stocks, meanwhile, attracted its biggest weekly inflow in almost a decade after president-elect Javier Milei signaled a more moderate tone ahead of taking office next month.

    "title": "Wells Fargo sees economic \"soft patch\" capping further S&P 500 gains",

    "author": "David Randall",
    "body": "By David RandallNEW YORK (Reuters) - An upcoming \"economic soft patch\" will likely weigh on the recent U.S. equity rally and stall sectors such as consumer discretionary and small-cap stocks, strategists at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute warned in a note on Monday.The firm cut its 2024 earnings estimate for the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks while maintaining its 2024 year-end S&P 500 target price range between 4,600 and 4,800. The index traded near 4,550 on Monday.While the U.S. economy is slowing, it has not deteriorated enough to justify the Federal Reserve beginning to cut interest rates, the firm noted. As a result, the economy will likely suffer from the squeeze of tighter credit longer than markets appear to anticipate, it said.\"It is our belief that equity rallies will be capped until a path to an economic and earnings recovery becomes clear,\" the firm noted, adding that it suggests investors add to large-cap technology stocks if the S&P 500 falls near the bottom of its range for the year.The benchmark S&P 500 is up more than 10% over the last three weeks as Treasury yields have fallen from 16-year highs following signs of cooling inflation and a weakening labor market, helping boost valuations in technology and other growth sectors. It hit a high for the year in late July as predictions of an imminent recession sank Treasury yields.The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow estimates show US gross domestic product growing at a 2.1% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, down from a third-quarter reading of 5.1% in early October.Overall, futures markets anticipate a 22% chance that the Fed begins cutting rates in March, up from a 13.7% chance seen a month ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.A re-acceleration of the global economy in the second half of 2024 will likely push stocks higher as a weakening dollar and falling interest rates spark a global risk rally, Wells Fargo said.(Reporting by David Randall)",

    "author": "AJ Fabino",
    "body": "The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) has a 52-week high of $459.44 and a 52-week low of $374.77.The ongoing exit from bear to bull market offers a chance for investors to reassess their investment strategies, one of which could be taking advantage of dividend yields.That’s where SPY, the S&P 500 ETF, comes into play.Don’t Miss:SPY currently has a dividend yield of 1.43%. So how would you yield $500 from it? Potential capital appreciation aside, let's do some math.To earn $500 a month, or $6,000 annually, with a dividend yield of 1.43%, you would need an investment of about $419,580, which equates to around 921 shares of SPY.If you’re aiming for a more modest amount, say $100 a month ($1,200 annually), you’d need an investment of approximately $83,916, translating to about 184 shares of SPY.Here’s how we calculate it: $6,000 / 0.0143 = $419,580 ($500 per month, $6,000 annually). $1,200 / 0.0143 = $83,916 ($100 per month, $1,200 annually).Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. If the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.Read Next:Photo: ShutterstockSend To MSN:  0\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!This article How To Earn $500 A Month From SPY Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

    "body": "By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are in a bull market and will post \"solid\" gains in 2024, even as returns are lower than this year, BMO Capital Markets strategists said on Monday.In a market outlook report, BMO Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski and his team projected the benchmark S&P 500 would end 2024 at 5,100, nearly 12% above Friday's closing level. The index is up more than 18% so far in 2023.\"We continue to believe that US stocks are in a bull market that has now entered its second year,\" the BMO strategists wrote in their report, adding that historical bull market performance patterns \"suggest lower, but still solid gains.\"Investors have various definitions of a bull market, although one common definition requires the S&P 500 to reach a new all-time high to confirm a bull market. The index has yet to breach its January 2022 record closing high of 4,796.56 in its rally this year.Separately on Monday, strategists at Deutsche Bank also forecast the S&P 500 would end 2024 at 5,100.BMO sees S&P 500 earnings rising about 13.6% in 2024, a \"significant rebound\" from this year. Earnings are expected to climb just 2.6% for 2023, according to LSEG data.\"We also believe that volatility is likely to subside as macro-environment resiliency continues to surprise alongside falling inflation,\" the BMO strategists said.The firm expects \"very different\" market leadership patterns next year with much more participation outside of the megacap stocks that have propelled equity indexes higher this year.\"We believe investors will need to own a little bit of 'everything' and not tilt too far in one direction or another from a sector, style, and size perspective - a sharp contrast to the trends that prevailed during 2023,\" the BMO strategists said.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Will Dunham)",

    "title": "Green Stock Selloff Deepens as Tesla Sentiment Sours",
    "published_at": "Mon, November 27, 2023 at 7:50 PM GMT+9",
    "author": "Greg Ritchie and Saijel Kishan",
    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The selloff that’s ripped through green stocks looks set to continue into 2024, bringing a fourth consecutive year of losses, according to Bloomberg’s latest Markets Live Pulse survey.Most Read from BloombergThe negative sentiment appears poised to engulf a wider array of green asset classes, with Tesla Inc. seen at risk of losing its place among the 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500. Almost two-thirds of the 620 MLIV Pulse respondents said they plan to stay away from the electric-vehicle sector, and 57% expect the iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund — which is down about 30% this year — to extend its slide in 2024.The gloomy outlook comes as green investors navigate the shock of a post-pandemic world shaped by much higher interest rates. And, there’s also the persistent political backlash in many US states, as well as an evolving regulatory backdrop that has the potential to expose greenwashing and further hurt valuations.Read More: Tesla May Fall Out of Top 10 S&P Companies: MLIV Pulse ResultsChat Reynders, who’s been a sustainable investor for three decades, calls the downturn in green assets a “watershed moment” for the industry. The hype that had surrounded going green to help address climate change has led some investors to take their eye off traditional financial metrics such as supply, demand and balance sheets, he said.“We’ll look back and say this was an era of extraordinary speculation,” said Reynders, who helps oversee about $3.5 billion as co-founder of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management in Boston. “Whether there was a meme stock or a green stock, everyone was marketing and selling extremely hard.”Though MLIV Pulse respondents are broadly united in their bleak view of green stocks in the near term, the picture is different when the time horizon is extended. Most respondents expect they’ll need to shield portfolios from climate risk in the coming years.Garvin Jabusch of Green Alpha Advisors in Louisville, Colorado, said the current selloff represents “a temporary pivot of capital away from renewables.” Brent Newcomb, president of Ecofin, which manages about $2 billion out of London and Kansas City, said he sees the market downturn as a buying opportunity and he’s adding to his positions in utility stocks.And Bill Green of Climate Adaptive Infrastructure from Mill Valley, California, said it’s “a red herring” to look at the value of publicly traded solar or wind stocks and conclude that the energy transition has stalled.“Public markets are notoriously fickle and have, in our view, overreacted to rising interest rates and supply chain challenges,” he said.In the MLIV Pulse survey, 38% of respondents said miners of critical minerals ranked as the best investment option among climate-related offerings. But timing the upturn is proving hard.Investors targeting environmental, social and governance goals had hoped this year would produce a rally thanks to historic levels of support in the form of packages such as the US Inflation Reduction Act. Instead, decades-high inflation and soaring interest rates ended up hammering a lot of traditional ESG stocks, with wind and solar standing out as some of the biggest losers.A lot of clean energy companies are capital intensive, which makes them more vulnerable to higher borrowing costs than oil and gas companies with well-established rigs and platforms. To make matters worse, wind and solar producers have been hit by project delays exacerbated by supply-chain bottlenecks, derailing plans and increasing costs.The next green asset class expected to see a decline is EVs, as battery-powered cars remain too costly for many households struggling with the long-term fallout of inflation. Tesla shares soared almost 140% this year through a July peak, but have since dropped about 20%.Two years ago, Tesla was valued at $1.2 trillion, briefly making it the fifth-largest company on the S&P 500. Its market value has since fallen below $800 billion, ranking it the eighth largest in the benchmark index. Almost 50% of MLIV Pulse respondents expect it to drop out of the top 10 next year. Tesla investors are also figuring out how to respond to a chief executive who regularly shocks markets with highly controversial social media outbursts.Yet the pace of climate change is forcing an inevitable pivot toward greener technologies, necessitating more investment.“Next year is an important one for the implementation and renewal of decarbonization targets, as Paris Accord decarbonization efforts require additional, front-loaded, net investments,” according to Barclays Plc analysts led by Maggie O’Neal. “With 2023 appearing likely to be the warmest year on record, and 2024 potentially being similarly hot, adaptation and decarbonization will remain in focus.”Against that backdrop, two-thirds of MLIV Pulse respondents expect climate change to affect portfolio values over the next three years. That echoes previous, similar surveys, with a Bloomberg Intelligence poll published earlier this month finding that 89% of investors acknowledge that ESG metrics are here to stay. And a poll of mostly US-based Bloomberg terminal users released in August found that about two-thirds said ESG is too important to ignore, even though they dislike the label.O’Neal at Barclays also notes that the political backdrop remains key.“Half of the world’s population will vote in elections in 2024,” she said. “As public policy drives many of the factors making ESG material to investors today, the outcomes of these elections matter.”The MLIV Pulse survey of Bloomberg News readers on the terminal and online is conducted by Bloomberg’s Markets Live team, which also runs the MLIV blog. Respondents include portfolio managers, traders and retail investors. This week, the survey asks what’s the best place to invest your extra cash.

    "title": "TipRanks’ ‘Perfect 10’ List: These 3 Top-Rated Stocks Hit All the Right Marks",
    "published_at": "Mon, November 27, 2023 at 7:01 PM GMT+9",
    "author": "TipRanks",
    "body": "It’s the most basic question investors face: What stocks to buy? The markets are tossing up a huge volume of data from millions upon millions of daily transactions, involving thousands of traders, dealers, and brokers, and thousands of public stocks. The data makes an imposing edifice – and is tailor made for data sorting tools like the Smart Score.The Smart Score is an AI-powered natural language algorithm, sophisticated enough to scan, collect, collate, and analyze all those reams of data – and then to compare every stock’s latest stats to a set of factors known to match up with future share outperformance. The result is distilled down to a simple, easily readable score, a single number on a scale of 1 to 10, showing investors at a glance the likely main track for any stock. And the ‘Perfect 10’ stocks are the shares that clearly deserve a closer look.So let’s do that, give some of these ‘Perfect 10s’ that closer look. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up the details on 3 stocks that have earned the Perfect 10; these are shares that have hit all the right marks, and checked all the right boxes – and investors should give them a closer scrutiny. Here they are, along with comments from the Street’s analysts.Celsius Holdings (CELH)First up is Celsius Holdings, an energy drink and nutrition company founded in 2004. Celsius focuses on the active lifestyle niche, offering a line-up of products that includes energy drinks, quick-boost energy supplements, and protein bars.Celsius bills itself as a partner for consumers’ active lifestyles. The company boasts that its drinks and supplements provide a full range of essential energy to boost metabolism and burn body fat. While designed to give consumers the extra lift they may need at the gym or during outdoor exercise and activities, the products are also useful during the ordinary workday, offering a combination of good taste and a power bump without recourse to artificial flavoring or preservatives. Celsius is proud that its products do not contain aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup.It’s a value proposition that has helped the company deliver beats on both the top-and bottom-line int its recent quarterly readout. Not only that, Celsius has a record-level quarter in 3Q23, with a top line of $385 million. This represented a 104% increase from 3Q22, and was $33.5 million above market expectations. At the bottom line, the firm’s GAAP earnings of 89 cents per diluted share came in 38 cents per share better than had been anticipated.For Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala, the key to this stock lies in the company’s overall niche potential. He writes, “Celsius’ opportunity should be framed in the context of a much bigger Energy+ category, versus Energy, which includes sports drinks, coffee, tea, and functional water. Energy+ is a $81b category (retail) in 2022 and is expected to grow 6% to $107b by 2027. For context this equates to $5b/year or $2.5b wholesale. Celsius should generate ~$1.3b in sales this year). Against this backdrop, Celsius’ only has 4% of Energy+ vs. 9% of the traditional energy drinks category. We think Celsius’ positioning as a fitness/lifestyle brand enables the company to benefit from overall category tailwinds. We expect sales to grow +39% through 2027 (5Y CAGR), equating to just 6% of Energy+.”For Gajrawala, this adds up to a Buy rating for the stock, and a solid price target of $72.33, suggesting a one-year gain of 35%. (To watch Gajrawala’s track record, click here.)The Strong Buy analyst consensus on CELH is based on 13 recent reviews, including 11 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock’s selling price of $53.56 and current average target price of $72.21 together indicate potential for a 35% gain on the one-year horizon. (See Celsius Holdings’ stock forecast.)Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)For the second stock on our list, we’ll turn to the energy sector – where Brookfield Renewable Partners holds an interesting niche position. The Bermuda-based firm is part of Brookfield Asset Management, one of the largest alt-investment firms operating in Canada and the owner of a 60% interest in BEP. This gives Brookfield Renewable Partners a solid backing, allowing the company to build a portfolio of energy projects, including distributed energy and sustainable energy operations, and conventional green energy projects, such as wind, solar, and hydro-electric power generation systems.Brookfield’s approach is to leverage asset classes from the backbone of the economy, and energy fits that bill perfectly. The company moves carefully before investing, gathering operational intelligence on its investment targets and then turning its intelligence insights into actionable investment moves. The result, for BEP, is a portfolio that now includes over 8,000 power generating facilities capable of producing 31,000 megawatts of usable power output. This is power generation at a utility-grade scale, and allows Brookfield to sell power for a stable cash flow.The company’s power portfolio is broken down into five categories, including: hydroelectric power, wind power, solar power, distributed generation, and sustainable solutions. For green-minded investors, there is sure to be something of interest here; Brookfield aims to demonstrate that responsible ‘green’ investing can walk hand-in-hand with profitability. Overall, the company’s energy portfolio is estimated at approximately $78 billion.This activity brought BEP $1.18 billion in revenue in 3Q23, along with a normalized funds from operations (FFO) of 45 cents per share. These figures were, respectively, in-line with the forecast and 6 cents per share better than expected.Nelson Ng, of RBC Capital, covers this energy investment firm, and he likes its ability to deploy its usable funds into projects capable of generating returns. He says, “We believe BEP is very well positioned to deploy capital at attractive returns that meet or exceed management’s 12–15% target. We think that even though public and private market renewable valuations are depressed, some peers have scaled back M&A activity and are preserving capital due to their limited access to capital and weak share prices. BEP ended Q3/23 with $4.4 billion of available liquidity, and together with institutional partners, it has the flexibility to execute large multifaceted transactions.”With inflation starting to decelerate, Ng foresees the interest rate regime turning favorable for this stock, and adds, “We believe interest rates and inflation expectations have mostly peaked, and the depressed public and private market renewable valuations provide BEP an attractive opportunity to deploy capital at potentially premium returns.”The analyst goes on to give these shares an Outperform (Buy) rating, with a $29 price target that points toward a 17% gain in the coming months. (To watch Ng’s track record, click here.)The 8 recent analyst reviews on BEP break down 6 to 2 in favor of Buys over Holds, giving the shares their Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s $28.68 average price target suggests a 16% upside from the $24.75 current trading price. (See Brookfield Energy Partner’s stock forecast.)AerCap Holdings (AER)Last on our list is AerCap Holdings, an aeronautical firm based in Dublin, Ireland. The company occupies a fascinating niche in the world of air travel – it owns commercial aircraft and engines, and leases them to carrier airlines. The company operates worldwide, as befits an important equipment supplier to the airline industry, and is the world’s largest such owner of commercial aircraft. AerCap is also the leading company in the aviation leasing industry.AerCap boasts an impressive portfolio of aviation assets, including more than 1,700 commercial aircraft, more than 300 helicopters, and approximately 1,000 aviation engines, mainly jets. The company’s order book includes 380 technologically advanced, fuel-efficient commercial planes, and the company can provide fleet solutions to airlines at all scales.Because – it is a little known, but not exactly hidden, secret in the airline industry that many carriers do not own their aircraft. Rather, they lease the equipment from outside providers, like AerCap, for long-term arrangements. The system works, allowing carriers to keep their planes flying, but giving them flexibility to alter their fleet composition when conditions demand.And going by AerCap’s recent 3Q23 report, demand has been solid. Revenue came in at $1.89 billion, up 10% y/y and a modest $10 million over the estimates. The bottom-line figure, an adjusted EPS of $2.81, was 42 cents better than had been forecast. The company reported $1.3 billion in quarterly cash from operations, and finished Q3 with $2.6 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand – a 48% increase from the end of 2022. These results reflect the company’s sound position as air travel increases post-COVID.This stock’s overall bullish outlook attracted Barclays’ Terry Ma, who drawsb investor attention to several appealing facets. “Our positive rating on AER shares is supported by the company’s strong cashflow profile and its unique capital return strategy,” Ma said. “AER has been able to create value for shareholders by selling assets at a double-digit GOS margin and buying back stock at a discount to book value and driving ~20% y/y book value growth. In addition, the lessor model is benefiting from both cyclical and secular tailwinds that should improve leasing returns going forward. AER’s leading market position as the world’s largest lessor should allow it to generate above-average returns over time.”These comments complement Ma’s Overweight (Buy) rating, and his $80 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 18.5%.This stock gets a unanimous Strong Buy vote from the Street, with 6 recent reviews all coming in positive. The shares are trading for $67.54 and their $82.67 average price target suggests the stock will gain 22.5% in the next 12 months.

    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- A meandering benchmark index and a slew of companies going private have left Canada’s capital markets in a precarious position.Most Read from BloombergThe number of companies leaving the country’s public markets has exceeded new ones joining. In 2023, 19 publicly listed Canadian firms have gone private and taken about C$12.5 billion off the Toronto Stock Exchange and junior TSX-Venture, including one that went bankrupt. Summit Industrial Income REIT, valued at $4.2 billion, and Home Capital Group Inc., which fetched a $4.1 billion valuation, were the two largest Canadian take-private deals this year.New listings haven’t kept pace. There has been just one initial public offering on the TSX this year and another 12 companies debuting on the junior exchange, raising a total of just $114 million.Read More: Toronto Stock Exchange Has 1 IPO This Year in Historic Dry Spell“Given how unreceptive the markets have been to IPOs generally, I don’t see a scenario where you wouldn’t have more take privates than IPOs,” said J.R. Laffin, co-head of capital markets and public mergers & acquisitions at Bay Street law firm Stikeman Elliott.Large private equity firms still have a lot of dry powder to deploy in public markets where small- and mid-cap firms are trading at discounted valuations, Laffin added.TSX Set to ShrinkPartly as a result of the privatizations, the total market capitalization on the TSX is teetering on the edge of a decline. It dropped to C$3.77 trillion ($2.8 trillion) at the end of October, a decline of 1.5% over the last 12 months, according to Bloomberg calculations. A annual contraction would be the first in five years, though so far the market value remains 1% higher on a year to date basis.More concerning is the 3.7% gain this year by the country’s main equities benchmark, the S&P/TSX Composite Index, a plodding figure when set against the 19% increase for the S&P 500.“Investors aren’t optimistic enough — just generally, right now — to give companies the benefit of the doubt, so most companies are holding off on plans to go public,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Andrew Silverman said, adding that “going private, on the other hand, is a much easier call to make.”A similar dynamic has played out elsewhere, with IPOs slumping amid volatility in the stock market and higher interest rates and going-private deals outpacing IPOs in the US this year. So far, there have been 58 companies taken private in the US this year for $120.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.However, the S&P 500’s performance and the Nasdaq 100’s 47% jump to a nearly two-year high have kept the US market on a growth trajectory for the year.Into that buoyant stock market, there was some hope for an IPO rebound in the US in September this year, but middling performance from those firms have weighed on go-public sentiment across the board, Stikeman Elliott’s Laffin said. For the time being, he expects privatizations to continue to outpace stock market debuts.“I don’t see a near-term catalyst for things to change,” he said.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "body": "(Reuters) — Deutsche Bank on Monday forecast the S&P 500 to end next year 12% higher as it expects corporate earnings to remain resilient even if the United States experiences a mild and short recession.Deutsche Bank analysts expect the index to end 2024 at 5,100 points. The S&P 500 is up close to 19% so far this year.The bank forecast earnings for companies in the benchmark index to rise 10% after factoring in a \"mild short\" recession and a 19% increase if U.S. gross domestic product grows by 2%.Deutsche Bank's 2024-end S&P 500 target is 8.5% higher than the 4,700 median forecast of 33 strategists polled by Reuters.\"If earnings growth continues to recover as we forecast, valuations will remain well supported around the top of the range as is typical on the pricing in of a pickup in earnings growth,\" the strategists said.Decline in core inflation to its pre-pandemic levels without growth having to slow could also support the benchmark index, as it would suggest the Federal Reserve would not cut rates unless a recession takes place, they added.As the effect of higher interest rates roll over, the brokerage expects a \"mild\" U.S. recession in the first half of next year, which it says will prompt the Fed to cut policy rates by 175 basis points. It forecasts the economy to expand by only 0.6% the year ahead.Last week, BofA Global Research said it expects the benchmark to end next year at 5,000 as macro concerns decline and the Fed puts rate hikes on hold.(Reporting by Roshan Abraham in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich, Mrigank Dhaniwala and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",
