    "title": "The housing market has hit 'rock bottom' and the sales slump will last a long time, Redfin CEO says",

      "The only good thing right now about the US housing market is that it can't get much worse from here, according to Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman.",
      "The head of the real estate listing site pointed to tough market conditions over the past year, with affordability plunging to an all-time-low, according to Goldman Sachs' housing affordability gauge.",
      "That's the fault of high mortgage rates, which have raised the cost of borrowing for prospective homebuyers, while also discouraging potential sellers from listing their homes. That's exacerbated the supply shortage and pushed up home prices even as demand falls due to higher rates.",
      "The median sales price for a single-family home inched back closer to its all-time-high last month, clocking in at $420,846 in August. Meanwhile, mortgage rates have stayed stubbornly above 7%.",
      "\"It's been a slow-building disaster,\" Kelman said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. \"The housing market is just taking a beating because affordability is at a four-decade low.\"",
      "Existing home sales have plunged to a seasonally adjusted rate of around 4 million a year, down from around 6.6 million a year in late 2020, according to the National Association of Realtors. And the small amount of homes that have been hitting the market are largely from homeowners who are selling out of necessity, due to events like marriage or job changes.",
      "That differs from previous housing slowdowns, where homeowners have been forced to sell their properties due to foreclosure risk.",
      "\"The only people who are moving are the ones who absolutely have to,\" Kelman added. \"I wouldn't call that a Goldilocks scenario, I would call that rock bottom. But that's where we are right now, and the only relief is that it can't go much lower.",
      "The sales slowdown is bound to last \"a long, long time,\" Kelman warned, as experts say affordability won't improve until mortgage rates dial back. But that's unlikely to happen over the next year, with central bankers keeping a hawkish eye on inflation,",
      "Fed officials raised interest rates aggressively over the past 18 months to tame high prices, a move that's helped push mortgage rates up to two-decade highs. Markets are pricing in an 44% chance interest rates will stay higher than 5% by the end of 2024, per the CME FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, Redfin expects the 30-year mortgage rate to ease to just around 6% by the end of 2023.",

      "House prices may be headed lower, dealing a blow to sellers but providing relief to buyers, two experts say.",
      "\"The only way out of the box, the only way to get sales back up is mortgage rates have to come down, incomes have to continue to improve, we have to avoid a recession, and I suspect we'll have to see some house price declines at some point here,\" Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandi, told Yahoo Finance this week.",
      "Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman made a similar call in a Fox News interview this week. Asked about Morgan Stanley's latest forecast of a 3% drop in home prices next year, he replied that a decline \"seems not just possible, but likely.\"",
      "The housing market ground to a halt this year, as the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting hikes to interest rates have boosted mortgage rates to two-decade highs.",
      "Homeowners who locked in much cheaper rates have balked at selling up and paying heftier monthly payments for their next place. Meanwhile, prospective buyers have been priced out, and many are waiting for rates to fall instead of settling for a worse home than they wanted.",
      "\"Housing's taken it on the chin, particularly demand,\" Zandi said. He pointed to new data showing annualized sales of previously owned homes fell below 3.8 million units in October, the lowest figure in 13 years. \"You have to go back to the teeth of the financial crisis to find sales that low,\" he said.",
      "The pandemic-fueled surge in house prices, coupled with much steeper mortgage rates, have fueled an affordability crisis that has caused transaction volumes to tumble — and Zandi warned there's no immediate relief on the horizon.",
      "\"I don't expect the housing market to come roaring back here, certainly not in 2024,\" he said. \"Probably won't be until 2025, 2026 before we see sales levels that are more consistent with what we've enjoyed historically.\"",
      "Redfin's Kelman struck a more optimistic tone, suggesting the housing space is already heating up.",
      "\"There has been a change in the market, a disturbance in the force,\" he said, highlighting that the amount of housing inventory has started to increase.",
      "The real estate brokerage chief explained that more people are listing homes, and many owners who failed to sell their homes this summer are relisting them at lower prices.",
      "\"The market has just been frozen because buyers and sellers can't agree on a price,\" Kelman said. \"For the first time, there's a break in the logjam where we might see a real drop in prices, and that is going to spur sales.\"",

    "title": "SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC): A Pinnacle Performer in the REIT Realm",
    "time": "Sat, November 25, 2023 at 7:27 AM GMT+9",
    "authors": "TipRanks",
    "body": [
      "I consider SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) to be a pinnacle performer in the realm of REITs. Despite the challenges posed by heightened interest rates in the real estate sector, SBA continues to achieve growth in its funds from operations. Managing approximately 48,000 communication towers for telecom giants, the company mitigates most of the risks tied to traditional retail, commercial, or industrial REITs. With shares currently trading at a 40% discount from their 2021 high, I am bullish on the stock.",
      "Despite overall market indices showing significant recovery, SBA Communications stock continues to trade approximately 40% below its 2021 peak of about $391. This situation arises from the fact that all REITs generally find themselves in a considerably more challenging position today compared to about two years ago. This is because the swift rise in interest rates during this period has had a detrimental impact on the very foundation of their business models.",
      "To delve deeper into this issue, it’s crucial to understand that REITs are obligated to distribute the majority of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. To support property acquisitions and expansions, REITs frequently turn to debt and equity issuance, as they typically retain minimal income.",
      "However, when interest rates are elevated, the cost of issuing debt rises, constraining a REIT’s capacity to expand through new investments. Simultaneously, the increased interest expenses on existing debt adversely affect current profitability.",
      "SBA Communications mirrors this trend, as evidenced by the company’s total debt ballooning from $5.65 billion to $14.77 billion over the past decade as it pursued its tower portfolio expansion. This should explain why investors remain wary about SBA’s investment case relative to the rest of the rest of the market.",
      "As I just highlighted, elevated interest rates impact all REITs, including SBA. Nonetheless, SBA stands out due to its distinctive strategy centered around telecommunication towers, giving it unique attributes that underpin a resilient performance. Unlike residential REITs grappling with soaring mortgages and commercial REITs contending with low occupancy rates, the telecom towers sub-industry demonstrates remarkable durability.",
      "This resilience is attributed to the mission-critical nature of telecommunication towers, which serve as indispensable assets for industry giants like AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Thus, telecom giants prioritize meeting their lease obligations to ensure seamless network coverage. This results in a dependable cash flow stream for SBA with comparatively lower risks compared to other REITs specializing in more conventional asset classes.",
      "SBA once again showcased its robust performance in the latest Q3 results, revealing an increase of 8.5% in leasing revenues. This growth can be attributed to an expanded tower portfolio and enhanced leasing activities. In particular, gross same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue experienced a substantial uptick of 8.8%. Domestically, the figures remain impressive, with a gross basis growth of 8.6% and a net basis growth of 4.7%, inclusive of a mere 3.9% churn.",
      "As you can see, even during such a tough macroeconomic environment, SBA’s churn rate is remarkably low, underscoring the resilience of telecom towers. Continual escalations in contractual rent and a steady rise in tenancies per tower consistently surpass any instances of relocations or vacancies. This recurrent industry trend guarantees a sustained increase in leasing revenues.",
      "Of course, grappling with the substantial impact of escalating interest rates, SBA has witnessed a notable deceleration in tower acquisitions and developments. Moreover, the company is paying notably higher interest expenses on its existing debt portfolio, which rose by about 14% year-over-year to reach $99.3 million in Q3.",
      "Despite these challenges, SBA has demonstrated resilience through prudent cost management and impressive top-line performance, enabling the company to maintain robust profitability. Notably, adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) experienced a 7.3% year-over-year increase, totaling $364.1 million. On a per-share basis, AFFO increased by 7.7%, further amplified by strategic share buybacks.",
      "With a robust Q3 performance from SBA, coupled with a strong first half of the year, the company’s management has elevated its FY2023 outlook. SBA is poised for growth, anticipating site leasing revenues between $2.510 billion and $2.520 billion (an increase from the previous range of $2.502 billion to $2.522 billion) and AFFO/share ranging from $12.91 to $13.13 (up from the previous forecast of $12.80 to $13.16).",
      "Significantly, the midpoint of management’s projected guidance, standing at $13.02, hints at a noteworthy year-over-year surge of 6.9%. This figure might not immediately strike as remarkable. However, achieving robust high-single AFFO/share growth in a market where the majority of REITs are grappling with double-digit declines in profits is truly commendable.",
      "Regarding Wall Street’s view on SBA Communications, the stock has gathered a Strong Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $252.27, the average SBA Communications stock price target implies 7.3% upside potential.",
      "If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell SBA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital, with an average return of 11.86% per rating and a 64% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.",
      "SBA Communications emerges as a standout performer in the current challenging landscape for REITs. Despite facing headwinds from elevated interest rates, the company’s unique focus on telecommunication towers sets it apart, ensuring a resilient performance. Its Q3 results verify this theme, with impressive leasing revenue growth and a low churn rate.",
      "While the effects of increasing interest rates found their way into SBA’s income statement, the company’s adept cost management and robust top-line performance have artfully set the stage for another year of record AFFO/share. However, despite outperforming its sector peers, SBA’s stock remains notably lower than its previous highs. This discrepancy suggests that it might be an opportune moment for investors to reevaluate SBA’s bullish case, which, in my perspective, presents a compelling opportunity.",

    "time": "Sat, November 25, 2023 at 4:01 AM GMT+9",
    "authors": "George Glover",
    "body": [
      "Politics hasn't tended to hold much sway over the stock market – but that could change in 2024, according to Lazard's chief market strategist.",
      "In the $216 billion asset manager's global outlook for 2024, Ronald Temple positioned the upcoming presidential election as a \"watershed moment\" that could have a major knock-on effect on both the global economy and equity prices.",
      "In a follow-up interview, he told Business Insider why he's expecting the November 2024 contest to be so crucial.",
      "While the past seven years have taken the US on a wild political ride, sometimes it's felt like the stock market has barely paid attention.",
      "Instead, investors have zeroed in on the economy – and since 2016, that's given them plenty of reasons to be cheerful, whatever voters think.",
      "Between his election in 2016 and 2021, Donald Trump – ranked by scholars as one of the worst presidents of all-time – oversaw a 50% surge for the S&P 500, which was powered higher by Republican tax cuts, strong growth, and historically-low interest rates.",
      "Since Joe Biden took office in 2021, the benchmark gauge has climbed another 19%, despite Wall Street's worries about high inflation and a recession that hasn't yet materialized.",
      "Ultimately, the fact many investors pick stocks based on a longer time horizon than four years means that who's in the White House doesn't tend to have much impact on the market, Temple said.",
      "\"I typically try to convey to people that a presidential election is not a game-changer for stocks,\" he told BI. \"You're buying all of a company's future cash flows, not just their cash flows for the next four years.\"",
      "But things could be very different come November, the strategist added.",
      "Temple is highlighting the 2024 election as a potential watershed moment because of how the contest could affect the global geopolitical balance.",
      "Under Biden, Congress has sent around $75 billion to war-torn Ukraine, per data from the Council of Foreign Relations. Last month, the President pledged to carry on providing assistance, despite Republican lawmakers blocking a request for additional funding.",
      "A Republican president could call time on that support. In primary debates, candidates Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy have indicated that they don't think giving financial aid to Kyiv should be a priority for the US.",
      "But Washington backing away from the Ukraine conflict could embolden Russia and China and set the stage for a full-blown geopolitical crisis that could hurt the global economy and drag on stock prices, Temple told BI.",
      "\"In this election, probably the most important thing from a market and long-term perspective is the geopolitical aspects,\" he said. \"Whether the US continues to finance and support Ukraine is basically on the ballot – and the signals that sends to Vladimir Putin and China will be very important for long-term economic stability and growth.\"",
      "\"That situation will be very important for the long-term cash flows of companies and the economy, so for me it's probably the most important issue of the election,\" Temple added.",
      "Ukraine and the presidential election aren't the only two issues Temple is keeping an eye on.",
      "The Lazard investing guru believes that monthly inflation prints will continue to be a defining issue for markets 2024, as the Federal Reserve gears up to start slashing interest rates in the second half of the year.",
      "Prices rose at a rate of just 3.2% in October, according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in a sign the central bank's aggressive interest-rate hikes are dragging inflation toward its 2% target.",
      "Investors' focus is now likely to shift to how soon rate cuts will come and how steep those cuts will be, according to Temple. Traders currently expect the central bank to start slashing borrowing costs in June, per the CME Group's Fedwatch tool.",
      "Temple told BI that rate cuts will provide a particular boost to small-cap stocks – but added that the Fed is unlikely to be so aggressive that the market echoes its returns two years ago, when 0% interest rates powered growth stocks to massive gains.",
      "\"The way I'm thinking about the equity market is I think there will be some relief for the companies that have been hit the hardest by rising rates,\" he told BI. \"One part of the market I'm particularly positive on right now is small caps – 40% of Russell 2000 companies lose money, so these are companies that rely on credit to stay afloat.\"",
      "\"You could get a bit of relief for some of the higher-growth names in the market, but I'd just caution that we're not going to go back to 2021,\" Temple added.",

      "Like Lenovo Group Limited (OTC: LNVGY) and Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL), HP has been struggling with a PC market slowdown that came after the pandemic-induced boom. Dell will be reporting earnings on November 30th, while Lenovo posted a 16% revenue decline last week as PC demand remained slow. But despite posting its fifth consecutive quarterly sales decline, Lenovo also expressed optimism regarding an AI-aided PC market recovery.",
      "The Palo Alto, California-based company reported revenue declines in both personal systems and printing with net revenue contracting 6.5% YoY to to $13.82 billion, slightly lower than Wall Street’s estimate of $13.85 billion. Personal Systems segment reported revenue contracted 8% to $9.4 billion while the printing division reported a sales drop of 3% to $4.4 billion. Earnings per share amounted to $0.97, improving from last year’s comparable quarter when HP lost $0.02 per share.",
      "HP CEO Enrique Lores stated that the company believes the development of AI will double the growth of the PC category starting as early as next year, as new computers with AI capabilities will help accelerate and grow the PC market.",
      "Lores stated that the PC market has begun to recover, while adding growth will also be supported by Microsoft that will be ttransitioning from Windows 10 to Windows 11. He also added that the second half of 2023 was stronger than the first half, with growth expected next year.",

Last week, Lenovo also confirmed it will be releasing its first \"AI PC\", a PC that will be able to make use of AI without the internet in the second half of 2024.",
      "HP guided for first quarter adjusted profit per share in the range between 76 cents and 86 cents, while LSEG’s consensus estimate amounted to 86 cents.  As for the fiscal 2024, HP guided for adjusted profit in the range between $3.25 to $3.65 per share.",
      "HP joined major PC makers, including Lenovo, in providing a positive signal that the two-year PC market slump could be coming to an end. Demand is likely to pick up for the holidays with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) also launching a Windows update next year. Microsoft will be reviving Windows 10 with an AI-Powered Copilot Assistant. The news came as a surprise considering that Microsoft was planning to retire the operating system in 2025 as the Copilot was initally available for Windows 11. But, Microsoft clearly made a significant strategy shift by committing to continue enhancing its Windows 10 software and expanding the reach of its AI -powered assistant to more than 1 billion users. But, considering its flagship software changed the way people across the globe interact with computers back in 1995, it seems right that even 'veteran' users get to experience the perks of the AI-enhanced software.",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) — U.S. business activity held steady in November, but employment in the private sector declined for the first time in almost three-and-a-half years, consistent with expectations for an economic slowdown in the fourth quarter.",
      "S&P Global said on Friday that its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, was unchanged at 50.7 this month as a modest rise in services sector activity offset a contraction in manufacturing. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the private sector.",
      "The survey's flash manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.4 this month from 50.0 in October. Its flash services sector PMI edged up to 50.8 from 50.6 in the prior month.",
      "Economists expect overall economic activity to moderate considerably this quarter as the lagged effects of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve start to have a greater impact. Since March 2022, the U.S. central bank has raised its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% band.",
      "The economy grew at a 4.9% annualized rate in the third quarter. Growth estimates for the October-December quarter are mostly below a 2% pace.",
      "The flash composite new orders index increased to 50.4 in November, ending three straight monthly declines. The modest rise from a reading of 49.0 in October was mostly driven by the services sector, with factory orders stagnant.",
      "The lack of strong order growth resulted in businesses shedding workers, with the survey's employment index dropping to 49.7. That was the first contraction since June 2020 and followed a reading of 51.3 in October.",
      "S&P Global said businesses commonly cited relatively muted demand conditions and elevated cost pressures as the reasons for layoffs, which were across both manufacturing and services sectors. Companies were also implementing hiring freezes.",

      "NEW YORK (Reuters) — Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.",
      "Equities have risen sharply, with the S&P 500 up over 8% in November, on the cusp of a new high for 2023, fueled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes. Yields fall when Treasury prices rise, and the lower returns on guaranteed fixed-income investments make stocks more appealing.",
      "While some big investors are skeptical the rally amounts to more than just a year-end rebound, recent signs of market strength include gains in areas that have lagged this year.",
      "In one encouraging sign, about 55% of the S&P 500 were trading above their 200-day moving averages as of Monday. That level breached 50% last week for the first time in nearly two months, according to LPL Financial.",
      "Breadth is finally starting to broaden out to levels more commensurate with bull markets,\" said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. \"This has been one of the keys to calling this recovery sustainable.\"",
      "Equal weight",
      "Among other signs, the equal-weight S&P 500 — a proxy for the average stock in the index — rose 3.24% last week. That was substantially more than the 2.24% rise for the market-cap weighted S&P 500, the biggest percentage point outperformance for the equal-weight index in nearly five months.",
      "Even so, the S&P 500 equal-weight index has gained just 3% in 2023, against an 18% rise for the overall S&P 500 — on pace for the biggest such annual percentage-point gap in 25 years.",
      "Much of that underperformance is due to the outsized gain in the Magnificent Seven stocks, which collectively hold a 28% weight in the S&P 500 index: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvdia, Meta Plaforms and Tesla. Overall, the group of stocks makes up nearly 50% of the weighting of the Nasdaq 100, which is up nearly 47% for the year to date.",
      "Struggling small-cap and bank stocks have perked up, especially after last week's U.S. consumer price data for October was unchanged from the prior month.",
      "The small-cap Russell 2000 is up 5.5% since the CPI data with the S&P 500 banks index up 6.5%, versus a 3% rise for the S&P 500. Year-to-date, the Russell 2000 is up 2%, while the S&P 500 banks index has fallen over 6%.",
      "Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said an environment that could be conducive for a broadening of the rally \"is starting to take shape.\"",
      "“This environment where rates are cooling, inflation is moderating and the Fed is on the sidelines, that is typically a good backdrop for risk assets,” Mahajan said.",
      "“Typically when rates start to move lower, you get valuation expansion and the areas that we could see some more meaningful valuation expansion is outside of large-cap tech,” she said.",
      "The equal-weight S&P 500 is trading at a 5% discount to its 10-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio, according to Edward Jones.",
      "Case against",
      "Still, there are reasons to think that the market rally is not on the verge of a sustained broadening.",
      "Investors will get further readings of consumer confidence and inflation next week. Stronger than expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.",
      "At the same time, the sharp rally in stocks for the week ended Nov. 17 was accompanied by high demand for upside call options, particularly in parts of the market that have underperformed this year, such as the small-caps focused iShares Russell 2000 ETF.",
      "Some of that has already started to unwind. \"We saw a huge pickup in expectations for IWM, but now those seem to have stabilized,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.",
      "The recent surge, which has pushed the broad S&P 500 up approximately 10% over the last three weeks, may not last as investors prepare to close their books for the year, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.",
      "\"A lot of good news is already priced in and investors may be reluctant to chase the rally,\" he said.",

      "Global stock funds have seen inflows of about $40 billion in the two weeks through Nov. 21 — the most since February 2022, Hartnett wrote in a note, citing EPFR Global data. Still, cash funds remain the winner with additions of nearly $1.2 trillion so far in 2023, compared with $143 billion into equities, while bond funds broadly registered outflows.",
      "Hartnett has remained bearish on stocks even as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 19% in 2023. The index is now up nearly 8.7% in November, one of the best performances in the last century, as investors bet the Federal Reserve could finally be done raising interest rates.",

Still, other market strategists are getting more optimistic about the outlook for US stocks, with teams including at RBC Capital Markets predicting a record high for the S&P 500 in 2024.",
      "Bank of America’s own quantitative strategists, led by Savita Subramanian, are also in the bullish camp as they expect that US companies have adapted to higher rates and weathered a macroeconomic jolt. Hartnett, on the other hand, has previously said he expects bonds to outperform next year.",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Climate negotiators at COP28 may bolster carbon trading when they decide on rules for a new United Nations-overseen emissions market that can lower the cost of fighting global warming.",
      "Most Read from Bloomberg",
      "In Dubai, envoys representing more than 190 nations are set to discuss standards for credits that allow their holders to compensate for pollution at home by investing in projects elsewhere to cut emissions or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The UN-sponsored program aims to ensure high quality credits within an internationally agreed framework, offering investors greater certainty amid concerns that some existing voluntary projects do little or nothing to curb climate change.",
      "“At COP28, regulators can help create demand by embracing acceptable quality standards that give voluntary buyers confidence,” said Benedikt von Butler, portfolio manager at Evolution Environmental Asset Management LP.",
      "The idea of using cross-border carbon markets to accelerate the green transition is nothing new. The Kyoto Protocol in 1997 paved the way for the Clean Development Mechanism: a program once worth $8.2 billion per year that boosted aid flows to emerging countries needing help in curtailing emissions.",
      "It allowed developed countries to use credits generated by cheaper greenhouse gas-cutting projects in developing nations to meet part of their pollution-reduction targets under the Kyoto treaty. After about six years of operation, prices collapsed close to zero in 2012 on concerns about the integrity of the projects and the European Union’s decision to limit the use of CDM credits for compliance in its domestic market.",
      "The concept got a fresh boost from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement: under Article 6, nations agreed to work toward a new global system of exchanging allowances covering greenhouse gases. In the following years, envoys worked on designing a robust financial instrument that would translate national emissions-reduction pledges into comparable, exchangeable units.",
      "Holy Grail",
      "“A successful and timely implementation of Article 6, often heralded as the Holy Grail of international cooperation in climate change, is seen as critical to the future of carbon pricing,” said Robert Jeszke, head of the Centre for Climate and Energy Analyses think-tank in Warsaw.",
      "The framework needs to be flexible enough to attract investment, while also credible enough to avoid the issues that sank the CDM. Some investors hope that a strong framework could open the door for carbon credits under the new UN program to be accepted in national or regional compliance markets across the world, such as the EU Emissions Trading System.",
      "The UN market will include a project-based mechanism, where companies can offset some residual emissions and reach voluntary net-zero climate goals by buying credits from registered pollution-reduction initiatives. The platform may attract investors currently relying on voluntary markets and serve as a model for initiatives that follow varying standards and governance frameworks.",
      "Way Forward",
      "Earlier this month, the new market’s supervisory body reached a deal on key technical rules to make the so-called Article 6.4 mechanism operational. The challenge now is for countries at COP28 to overcome remaining divisions and approve those recommendations in Dubai.",
      "“We were able to find a way forward that allows us to deliver on our mandate and sets out a work programme to continue improving and expanding the framework for the Paris Agreement crediting mechanism,” the supervisory body’s chair Olga Gassan-zade said in a statement on Nov. 18.",

      "Voluntary carbon credit projects attracted $36 billion of investment between 2012 and 2022, according to data by Trove Research, which was recently acquired by MSCI. It estimates that a further $90 billion of project investment will be needed to deliver the volume of credits required this decade to avoid exceeding the critical 1.5C warming limit.",
      "“We now hope the agreement will be adopted at COP28, so further technical work can kick off next year and the first credits can be issued towards the end of 2024,” said Andrea Bonzanni, international policy director at the IETA association, promoting carbon markets. “Without this agreement, everything would have been pushed back to 2025.”",

      "Stocks have enjoyed a red-hot November, and the recent rally has left some hedge funds with an estimated $43 billion in losses after betting on equities to move lower, according to a Wednesday Financial Times report citing data from S3 Partners.",
      "Hedge funds and money managers that have tried to short US and European equities — that is, bet on stock prices falling — have been caught off guard as the market has rallied this month as investors grow optimistic that the Federal Reserve is finished raising interest rates.",
      "With a more than 7% gain in November, the S&P 500 is on pace for its best month since July 2022.",
      "Some institutional investors had built up short bets against companies they thought would buckle amid the higher-rate environment. However, with confidence returning to markets, some of those trades aren't panning out.",
      "The FT notes that analysts say some hedge funds have had to repurchase stocks to cover their short bets as a \"short squeeze\" pushed share prices even higher.",
      "According to S3 data, bets against technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary were the most painful for hedge funds. Painful trades in the month include Carnival Corp, which jumped 14% in the week before Monday and cost short sellers about $240 million.",
      "To that point, a Goldman Sachs index that tracks the S&P 500 names with the highest total dollar value of short interest outstanding is on pace for its best month since last October.",
      "Meanwhile, on Tuesday, strategists at DataTrek Research pointed to US large-cap sector correlations as reason to believe stocks will continue to move higher through the end of the year.",
      "\"When [investors] see clear skies ahead, correlations tend to be low as they pick and choose between individual sectors and stocks,\" the firm's cofounders Nicholas Colas and Jessica Rabe said. \"When investors are concerned that a recession is brewing, whatever the cause, correlations are high because they see too much risk in owning equities as an asset class. Everything gets sold in such an environment.\"",
      "\"The bottom line here is that we believe US equities will continue to rally in the coming weeks,\" the strategists maintained.",
